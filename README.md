GIT: is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
GITHUB: is online database that allows you to keep track of and share your Git version control projects outside of your local computer/server.
Repository: is a storage or directory where your projects can live. Can be created via github and webstorm.
Clone: can "duplicate" a repository that creates a local copy of the remote repo. Now all your edits will be done locally rather than directly in the source files
Commit: is a command. Using the git commit saves a new commit object in the local git repository.
Push: The git push command is used to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is how you transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repo.
Pull: The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content. 
Branch: pointer to a snapshot of your changes 
Merge:
Merge Conflict: A merge conflict is an event that occurs when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
Fetch: The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo.
Remote: A remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server.
